      <h1>1977 and 2003 Blackouts</h1>
      <div id="intro">
        <p>In 1977, New York City went dark for a night, and hudreds of stores were set ablaze and looted only one summer after the Son of Sam murders. At 8:37pm on Wednesday, July 13th, 1977, New York City lost power for 25 hours--Rockaways, Soutern Queens, and the Pratt Institute were the only places that had power. Two more forceful strikes hit by 9pm, and the entire city was wiped out of power as critical transmission lines were battered. Airports were closed for 8 hours, stores were looted, and companies were set ablaze. On Broadway in Brooklyn, 134 stores were looted, and 45 were set ablaze.<p></p>
       However, these lootings occured after an infamous precedent in regards to the Vietnam War: student protests at universities nationwide. Only a few of these protests utilized violence, but of the few, their message was clearly heard. Students attacked 197 Reserve Officers' Training Corporation buildings, forcing imposed costs onto the government, and Nixon was listening. These protestors forced their message of war disproval to be heard by the government, and Nixon deescalated the war in the early 1970s, pulling troops in '73 and ending it in '75.
        Imposing costs upon a higher power coerces that power into listening. When white stores and corporations within low income areas in Bed Stuy, Brooklyn were set ablaze, these figures were required to listen to minorities and to see the living differences. Power was given to the powerless. <p></p>
        Flashing forward to 2003, New York City faced another blackout, this one being the second largest in the nation at the time, stretching to Canada and hitting 8 states. Around 4pm on August 14th, the electricity grid for the Eastern United States became overloaded. Only two years after 9/11, New York City police were petrified. Counterterror officers were dispatched all over the city's landmarks, including Central Park, Washington Square, and Times Square. Fighter planes flew through no-fly zones, and air patrol accompanied them as a precaution. 600 subways and trains screeched to a halt. New York City flights were even diverted to the surrounding states. In total, 50 million people were affected. <p></p>
        This time, although, the city was adapted. In Bed Stuy, metal store gates protected windows and displays from breaking. There was significantly less looting, but in Lower Manhattan, a shoe store was broken into, its owner beaten by a group of teens. Besides this case, looting was prevented, and mixed with the fear of 9/11, New Yorkers took the day off. Mayor Bloomberg instructed the city to "treat it as a snow day," and they did exactly that. With the heat of the summer, many lit candles and had dinner under the stars or in the dark. <p></p>
        The blackout of '03 proved less tense on the city after the precedent of '77. August of Another Brookln faced the more powerful of the two, witnessing her own neighbors return home with televisions and new shoes, riding "through [the] neighborhood in convertibles, tops down." (79). The privilege of many white communities that bear fancy cars and wear expensive shoes spread to Bed Stuy for the first time, signifying that the '77 blackout brought riches to the poor, with goods stolen from companies and people that can afford it.
