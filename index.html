      <h1>Another Brooklyn by Jacqueline Woodson</h1>
      <h2><a href="prologue.html">Zeitgeist: 1977 Blackout vs. 2003 Blackout </a></h2>
      <h2><a href="leaflet.html">Setting: Bed Stuy Brooklyn</a></h2>
      <p>Another Brooklyn follows the memories of August who has just lost her father. August rides the New York City subway following the funeral procession of her father, and she runs into an old-time friend, Sylvia. This encounter wracks August's brain, triggering a lifetime of memories starting from the death of August's mother in SweetGrove Tennessee and the exodus from Tennessee to Brooklyn. Through the memories of August, we meet Sylvia, Angela, and Gigi, three other Brooklynites that introduce the region to August and take her under their wings. This webpage will show you the locations of the fours' adventures, along with the New York City Blackout of 1977 and 2003, a treacherous time for the island of Manhattan and the boroughs.</p>
      <p class="second-paragraph">This website is broken into two sections, which are above: the Zeitgeist link, exploring the major New York City blackouts of 1977 and 2003, and the Setting link, showing the location of Bed Stuy, Brooklyn</p> <p
