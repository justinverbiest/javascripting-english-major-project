      <h1>The Bed Stuy to Bushwick Border</h1>
      <div id="first-map" class="map"></div>
      <p>Above at the pin listed, you can see the border on Broadway between Bed Stuy (left side) and Bushwick (right side) in Brooklyn. Along the street noted above, several stores were looted, as discussed on the blackout page. This location is pivotal to the story as August, her brother, and father live somewhere in Bushwick on the right side of Broadway.  <p></p>
      In the story, Broadway represents a forbidden land to August and her brother but a Mecca for those in need of groceries, shoes, or cars. Connecting back to the blackout page, Woodson writes, "We [August and her brother] saw children running toward Broadway and asked [their father] again and again if we could go. It's stealing, my father said. We don't steal." August continues, "We had heard for years that the shop owners on Broadway were white and lived in fancy houses in places like Brentwood, Rego Park, Laurelton," (80). <p></p>
      Though they would be stealing from upper-class white people, August's father tells August that she and her family are not those types of people. This quote shows the power of August's father, turning down free appliances and goods even from the whites in power that constantly oppress people of color. <p></p>
      Living in a location where "white people [they] didn't know filled trucks with their belongings...[taking] long looks at the buildings they were leaving," shows the privilege of whites that choose to take off as more people of color move in (21). This 1970s, this Brooklyn comprised of white people escaping Bushwick, or white neighbors that never play, was never enjoyable for people of color. The hippie movement and the rock n' roll of the 70s came with major oppression towards people of color, especially in lower income communities like this one, where the door to Gigi's building breaks, and a veteran rapes her in the dark. This Brooklyn is a cold, mean, and scary place where August's neighbor is addicted to drugs, where children play with needles "like a gun," and where mothers die far too early. The American experience has never favored people of color, and Another Brooklyn shows this oppression past the border of Bed Stuy and Bushwick.
